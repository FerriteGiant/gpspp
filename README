---Process outline---

1. Enter login info into uploadGPSdata.conf
2. Run batchGPSupload.sh
	- This calls login.sh which sources uploadGPSdata.conf,
	  sends login request, and then saves the output to loginOutput.html
	- For each file uploadGPSdata.sh is called
	- This parses the loginOutput.html file by calling parseline.awk
	  to obtain the needed info
	- Submits the file and outputs confirmationPage.html
	- Parses confirmationPage.html and creates the download link which 
	  is then saved to the file downloadurls.log (calls findOutputURL.awk)
	- Sleeps for a random time between minSeconds and maxSeconds
		-Note: It will sleep one last time after the last upload
3. Run batchPPdownload.sh <url file> <save directory>
	- Downloads all files linked to in the downloadurls.log file
	- Saves them to the user specified directory
	- Appends .finished to the file name to for the sake of record keeping
		- files will be ignored by git
